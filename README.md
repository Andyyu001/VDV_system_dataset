# VDV_system_dataset

We constructed a computational twin of the VDV system within the asymmetric ratchet channel. The simulation is strictly governed by underdamped
Langevin dynamics with deﬁned translational and rotational degrees of freedom. A dataset of 100 independent realizations was generated.

This dataset have been uploaded to quark network disk [https://pan.quark.cn/s/ec3b0d1ba3b6]. The data is strictly for academic research purposes and must not be used for commercial activities.
